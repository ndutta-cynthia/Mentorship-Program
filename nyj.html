        In the first chapter of his memoir "Born a Crime," Trevor Noah takes us back to his early years in South Africa. By describing Noah's unique situation as a mixed-race child born to a black Xhosa mother and a white Swiss father the chapter establishes the tone for the remainder of the novel. The book's title comes from Noah's description of how it was a crime just to be alive.<br>
        <br>

Noah explores his early years in greater detail in the second chapter, with an emphasis on his bond with his mother, Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah. Patricia is portrayed as a strong, self-reliant lady who overcame many obstacles and disregarded social expectations to support her kid. She gave Trevor valuable lessons in comedy, sensitivity, and resilience despite the hard reality of their Soweto existence.<br>
<br>

Noah shares several experiences from his early years that illustrate the challenges of growing up in a segregated culture. He tells heartbreaking but amusing tales that highlight the cruelty and ridiculousness of apartheid legislation. In addition to providing us with entertainment, Noah's stories inform us about the difficult circumstances that many South Africans had to deal with.<br>
<br>
We are brought into Noah's world and learn about his early years, which were formed by love, joy, suffering, and tenacity, as the story is told in these first two chapters.<br>
<br>
This book brings out some major issues in my community which include tribalism, racism,violence, apartheid, racism, the poverty cycle, community, growth of the Self, resilience through humor, education, and Religion.
